# List of active streamflow projects

## Precip based linear mixed models
	-using precip data associated with stream gages via spatial join
	-linear mixed models of streamflow variablity 

## Non hierarchal models based on single stream gage and/or year
	-reduce scale to attempt to better understand process model
	
## Heteroskedastic models accounting for differences in variability between gages and/or years
	-random effects based
	-spatially explicit?

## Mdels using a gamma data model
	-all the benefits of a truncated normal (well most of them) maybe with less issues?
