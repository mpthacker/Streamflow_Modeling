# List of active streamflow projects

## Precip based linear mixed models
	-using precip data associated with stream gages via spatial join
	-linear mixed models of streamflow variablity 
	-on hold due to lack of data support for random affects models

## Non hierarchal models based on single stream gage
	-reduce scale to attempt to better understand process model
	-will eliminate issues with vast differences between gages

## models using a gamma data model
	-all the benefits of a truncated normal (well most of them) maybe with less issues?
