# List of future streamflow projects, not ordered, more of a brainstorm

## Spatial autocorrelation tests of model residuals
	-any model even remotely suited to the data
	-test residuals for autocorrelation ie: Moran's I

## Look into CAR models to capture spatial pattern
	-Bayesian CAR models to account for spatial struc.
	-see if framework can be applied here

## Half cauchy variance prior for random affects 
	-as opposed to uniform or gamma prior
	-weakly informed vs. uninformative
	-bias variance away from large estimates. 

## Look into more watersheds with a more complete data record
	-only examining 11 year period for 16 gages, not a ton of samples in each group. Essentially panel data

## Poisson data model for the frequency of high flow events in a given time frame
	-fit on a river by river level
	-find some relative way of describing high flow events across whole river system ie: z score
		-z score will impose a normal data model which may not be appropriate given then evidence in my other models

## Look into literature on methods of streamflow prediction
	-SWAT
	-Ideally bayesian but any approach may help with process models

## Incorporate dam removal information available from USGS into model
	-linear breakpoints? 
		-Multibreakpoint models from ice core project need a lot work before they work with this framework
 	-using a categorical (ie number of dams removed from watershed in last n years) seems unlikely to work
		-assumes each dam affect is roughly equal and that they scale linearly which seems very wrong
	-Maybe try looking at major dam removal events and modeling watershed before and after 
		-Seems to be common in the literature
